# School Algorithms
**school_algorithms** is a **Python** module for secondary school maths and physics equations.
It aims to provide a simple way for secondary school students
to learn and calculate equations that they often use.

### Functions include:
- _A function that calculates power from energy and time
- _A function that calculates energy from power and time
- _A function that calculates time from power and energy
- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle
- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate a leg of a right-angled triangle
- _A function that calculates the area of a triangle
- _A function that calculates the area of a trapezium
- _A function that calculates the area of a circle
- _A function that calculates the volume of a right rectangle pyramid
- _A function that calculates the circumference of a circle

#### To import:
```
import school_algorithms
```
